                <h1> About Me </h1>
                <p>Hello, and welcome to my Webiste!</p>
                <p>My name is Noah Unverzagt, and I am a college student pursuing a degree in Web Development at Metropolitan Community College in Omaha, Nebraska. My objective is to obtain an entry-level position as a Front-End Developer, where I can apply my skills and continue to grow professionally.</p>

                <p>I am currently employed at Nebraska Furniture Mart while completing my studies. Most of my web development experience has come through academic projects, but I have also completed two internships that have broadened my practical knowledge of the field.</p>

                <p>The first was with the <strong>Childhood Cancer Society</strong>, where I gained valuable experience in the design process and learned how to collaborate effectively with a team to bring a shared vision to life. The second was with <strong>Nebraska Furniture Mart</strong>, where I was introduced to Agile development practices, the fundamentals of SQL, and backend technologies such as ASP.NET.</p>

                <p>I am passionate about building user-friendly, accessible websites and am eager to contribute to a professional development team.</p>
