                    <h1>Overview</h1>
                    <p>Hello, and welcome to my Webiste!</p>
                    <p>My name is Noah Unverzagt, and I recently graduated with a degree in Web Development from Metropolitan Community College in Omaha, Nebraska. I am actively seeking an entry-level position as a Front-End Developer, where I can apply my skills, contribute to real-world projects, and continue growing professionally.</p>

                    <p>While completing my degree, I worked at Nebraska Furniture Mart, where I also completed an internship as a developer. In addition to academic coursework, I've gained valuable hands-on experience through two internships that expanded my practical knowledge of the field.</p>

                    <p>At <strong>Childhood Cancer Society</strong>, I was involved in the design process and collaborated with a team to bring creative concepts to life. During my internship at <strong>Nebraska Furniture Mart</strong>, I worked within an Agile development environment and was introduced to backend technologies such as <strong>ASP.NET</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>.</p>

                    <p>I am passionate about front-end development and excited to join a professional team where I can contribute, learn, and grow as a developer.</p>

                    <h1>More about me</h1>
                    <p>When I'm not building websites, you'll likely find me immersed in a great film, exploring new music, or capturing moments through photography while traveling. Movies and music fuel my creativity, while photography encourages me to pay attention to details and perspectives that might otherwise go unnoticed. These passions shape how I approach my work: with curiosity, creativity, and an appreciation for both the big picture and the finer details.</p>
                    <p>I value collaboration and believe the best ideas often come from working closely with others. I enjoy contributing to team projects where I can share my perspective while also learning from different approaches. Whether working independently or as part of a group, I strive to stay adaptable, open to feedback, and focused on creating thoughtful, effective solutions.</p>
